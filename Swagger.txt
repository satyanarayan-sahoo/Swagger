                                                              Swagger
                                                              =======
->Now a days REST and Microservices have got a lot of momentum. At the same time, actual REST specification does not suggest
  any standard way to document the REST APIs that we are going to expose [like WSDL for SOAP]. As a result, everybody is
  documenting their APIs in their own way, resulting a gap in common structure which all can easily follow, understand and
  use. We need to have a common pattern and tool.Swagger (backed by companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft) does this same
  job of filling the gap of common documentation style.

1.What is Swagger?
==================
->Swagger (now the “Open API Initiative”) is a specification and framework for describing REST APIs using a common language
  that everyone can understand. There are other available frameworks that have gained some popularity, such as RAML, 
  Summation etc. but Swagger is most popular at this point of time considering its features and acceptance among the 
  developer community.
->It offers both human readable and machine readable format of documentation. It provides both JSON and UI support. JSON can
  be used as machine readable format and Swagger-UI is for visual display which is easy for humans to understand by just 
  browsing the api documentation.

2.Swagger2 Maven Dependencies
=============================
->Open pom.xml file of the spring-boot-swagger2 project and add below two swagger related dependencies i.e. 
  springfox-swagger2 and springfox-swagger-ui.

       <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.springfox/springfox-swagger-ui -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
            <artifactId>springfox-swagger-ui</artifactId>
            <version>2.9.2</version>
        </dependency>

        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.springfox/springfox-swagger2 -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
            <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
            <version>2.9.2</version>
        </dependency>

3.Verify Swagger2 JSON Format Docs
==================================
->Open the link http://localhost:8080/swagger2-demo/v2/api-docs and it should give the entire documentation in JSON format. 
  This is not that much easy to read and understand, actually Swagger has provided this to be used in other systems like API
  management tools now a days popular, which provides the functionality like API gateways, API caching, API documentation etc.

4.Verify Swagger2 UI Docs
=========================
->Open http://localhost:8080/swagger2-demo/swagger-ui.html to see the Swagger UI documentation in the browser.

5.Example:
==========
@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class Swagger2Configuration {
	@Bean
	public Docket ssaWebApi() {
		return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2).select()
				.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("com.swagger2.demo.controller"))
				.paths(PathSelectors.any()).build().apiInfo(metaData());
	}

	private ApiInfo metaData() {
		ApiInfo apiInfo = new ApiInfo("Swagger REST API",
				"Swagger Rest API Demo Application.",
				"2.0",
				"Terms of service",
				new Contact("Satyanarayan Sahoo",
						"https://www.facebook.com/satyanarayan.sahooraaz",
						"satyanarayansahoo.2717@gmail.com"
						),
				"Apache License Version 2.0",
				"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0", Collections.emptyList());
		return apiInfo;
	}
}// class
